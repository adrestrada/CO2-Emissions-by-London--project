,"The subset data represents carbon dioxide emissions within the scope of influence of Local Authorities. This dataset was used to report progress against National Indicator 186.  The full dataset includes all the emissions that occur within the boundaries of each local authority; however, the dataset of emissions within the scope of LAs  excludes certain emissions, which it has been considered local authorities are unable to directly influence.",,,,,,,,,,
